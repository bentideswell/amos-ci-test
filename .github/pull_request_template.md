Promotion, Backport or Cascade PR (e.g. dev -> uat, uat -> main, a hotfix
backport)? Skip this template entirely — delete everything below and
replace it with a single line, e.g.:

    Promotion: dev -> uat
    Backport: hotfix/invoice-fix -> main

No Release Notes or Client impact section is needed for these; the PR
content check doesn't apply to this PR type.

<!--
PR TITLE: Conventional Commits format — <type>: <short description>
  e.g. feat: add invoice export to datahub module
  Types: feat / fix / chore / docs / test / refactor / perf
  (hotfix: / patch: are reserved for hotfix branches on uat/main — see the
  Git Branching & Workflow Standard)
This drives the automatic version bump. Don't skip the prefix.

## Release Notes

<!--
INTERNAL — read verbatim by the build pipeline for the deployment manager.
Keep the heading exactly as "## Release Notes"; it's parsed literally.
A sentence or two is enough for most PRs — it's fine for this to closely
echo the title, just written for someone reading a changelog rather than a
diff. Only break it into ### Added / ### Changed / ### Fixed if this PR
genuinely spans more than one of them; don't add empty subsections just to
match a template.
-->



## Client Impact

<!--
CLIENT-FACING — read by the release-notes plugin. One sentence, in words a
client's admin/HR/registry staff would use, not developer language. Write
"Client impact: none" if this has no client-visible effect (refactor, tests,
CI, tooling, dependency bump). It's fine for this to closely echo the
Release Notes line above — you don't need to force them to differ.

The "client-facing" label is applied automatically from this line — don't
add or remove it yourself.
